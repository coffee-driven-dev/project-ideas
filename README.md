## Project Ideas

#### HTML5 Canvas Game powered by Twitch Channel Chat and C# Websockets
A simple HTML 5 canvas game that adds "new players" the first time a user sends a message in Twitch chat. After their player is created, basic commands exist to move their player and to assist in accomplishing objective(s).

**Notes:**
- [Creating a Twitch App (registration + docs)](https://dev.twitch.tv/get-started)
- [Code samples for interacting with Twitch Chat in other languages](https://github.com/twitchdev/chat-samples)
- [WebSockets support in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/websockets?view=aspnetcore-2.1)
